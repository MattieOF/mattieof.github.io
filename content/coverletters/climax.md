Climax Studios is one of the strongest studios in a wide area, and I'm eager to work at a strong studio like yours. I believe I have the skills nessesary to contribute heavily to your talented team, and I believe it would be an amazing opportunity to progress my career, and myself.

I have experience in game engines such as Unity and Unreal, and the programming languages they involve, such as C# and C++. I also have experience in using C++ for lower level applications such as game engine programming. I also have knowledge in the Adobe suite and 3D art toolkits such as Blender, and web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A portfolio of my work is available at [mattware.dev](https://mattware.dev/), or my GitHub at [github.com/mattieof](https://www.github.com/MattieOF/).

I'm able to work in a team to develop well-performing and engaging experiences and I have experience doing so after projects during my education. However, I'm still able to work well independently.
