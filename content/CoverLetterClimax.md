Climax Studios is one of the few game development studios nearby, and I'm eager to work at a strong studio like yours. I believe I have the skills nessesary to contribute heavily to your talented team, and I believe it would be an amazing opportunity to progress my career, and myself.

I have experience in game engines such as Unity and Unreal, and the programming languages they involve, such as C# and C++. I also have experience in using C++ for lower level applications such as game engine programming. I also have knowledge in the Adobe suite and 3D art toolkits such as Blender, and web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A portfolio of my work is available at [mattware.dev](https://mattware.dev/).
