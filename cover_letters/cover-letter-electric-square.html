    <p class="mb-6">29th November 2024</p>
    <p class="font-bold mb-6">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>As a second-year BSc Computer Games Technology student, I am eager to bring my strong skills in C++ & C# programming
      and passion for game development to the team at Electric Square.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Over the past 3 years, I have developed my programming skills through multiple personal and academic
      projects. For instance, Pirate Survivors was an Unreal Engine project in which I helped create a multiplayer
      survivors-like, for which I designed robust and performant systems on top of Unreal Engine's replication system,
      allowing us to replicate hundreds of experience item drops. As well as that, I used the engine's reflection system
      to allow designers to easily create upgrades from available properties. Furthermore, I have recently been working
      on a small multiplayer 2D shooter as the team lead. It is written in C++ and has a custom preprocessor tool written in C#,
      with OpenGL for rendering, Steamworks for networking, FMOD for audio, and more.</p>
    <p class="mt-2"></p>
    <p class="mt-2">I believe these experiences make me a good fit for a programmer role at Electric Square - they
      have not only solidified my technical knowledge, but the multiple group projects have taught me the importance of
      collaboration - I'd love to work along designers and artists to help achieve a creative vision fully. Therefore,
      the opportunity to work on exciting projects as part of a skilled team excites me.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I am available to commence a full-time placement in the summer of 2025, willing to relocate
      (especially to Brighton, which I've loved the times I have been), and am eligible
      to work in the UK without the need for Visa sponsorship. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills
      and experiences align with the needs of your team.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to games
      with a passionate, creative, and collaborative team, and developing my skills at Electric Square.</p>
    <p class="mt-10">Sincerely,</p>
    <p class="mt font-bold">Matt Ware</p>
