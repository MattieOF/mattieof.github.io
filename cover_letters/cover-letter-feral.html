    <p class="mb-6">24th November 2024</p>
    <p class="font-bold mb-6">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>I am excited to apply to become a Game Developer intern at Feral. As a second-year BSc
      Computer Games Technology student, I am eager to bring my strong skills in C++ programming and passion for game
      development to the team.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Over the past 3 years, I have developed my programming skills through multiple personal and academic
      projects. Most recently, I have been working on a multiplayer 2D game in C++, utilising low-level libraries such
      as SDL, OpenGL, Steamworks, and FMOD. Using GitHub Actions, I have been ensuring that the game always compiles on
      both Windows and Linux, requiring me to learn the Unix shell and set up an Ubuntu VM, and fix bugs caused by
      differences between MSVC and GCC.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Furthermore, I have created many projects in Unreal Engine 5 over the past couple of years; Pirate
      Survivors utilised custom systems built on top of Unreal's reflection system to replicate thousands of objects
      over the network. As well as that, Chemicode featured a custom drag-and-drop scripting engine virtual machine
      for use in a puzzle game. All of these projects were created using Unreal's C++ API.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I believe these experiences make me a good fit for a software engineer role at Feral - they
      have not only solidified my technical knowledge, but the multiple group projects have taught me the importance of
      collaboration. Therefore, the opportunity to work on commercial games with a skilled team at Feral excites me.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I am available to commence a full-time placement in the summer of 2025, willing to relocate, and am eligible
      to work in the UK without the need for Visa sponsorship. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills
      and experiences align with the needs of your team.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to games
      with a passionate team, and developing my skills at Feral.</p>
    <p class="mt-10">Sincerely,</p>
    <p class="mt font-bold">Matt Ware</p>
