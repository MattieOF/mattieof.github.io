    <p class="mb-6">22nd November 2024</p>
    <p class="font-bold mb-6">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>I am excited to apply for the Programming Intern position at Bulkhead. As a second-year BSc
      Computer Games Technology student, I am eager to bring my strong skills in C++ programming and passion for game
      development to the Codemasters team, contributing to the next generation of F1 games.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Over the past 3 years, I have developed my programming skills through multiple personal and academic
      projects. For instance, Pirate Survivors was an Unreal Engine project in which I helped create a system for
      designers
      to easily create upgrades, designing our custom editor to make it easier for non-designers. I used
      Unreal Engine's reflection code to retrieve all available properties and provide a combo-box, instead of requiring
      designers to type it manually. More recently, I have  been working on a small multiplayer 2D shooter
      written entirely in C++ with OpenGL, for which I have used libraries to implement Multi-Channel Signed Distance
      Field based text rendering.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Furthermore, I have been the sole UI programmer and designer on all of my projects. I have experience
      with Unreal Engine's UMG system, including porting an editor-only widget to the runtime with C++in Chemicode.
      I have also created UI systems from scratch in C# with Raylib, GML and GameMaker, and in a C++/OpenGL project. In
      a placement at EA, I'd like to further my knowledge of UI techniques, including the MVVM architecture.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I believe these experiences make me a good fit for a software engineer role at Codemasters - they have not
      only solidified my technical knowledge, but the multiple group projects have taught me the importance of collaboration
      - I'd love to work along designers and artists to help achieve a creative vision fully. Therefore, the opportunity to work on
      a global franchise at Codemasters excites me.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I have completed the virtual job simulation mentioned on the job listings. From this experience, I
      found the process satisfying and rewarding, and would like to contribute effectively to existing and new commercial
      codebases.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I am available to commence a full-time placement in July 2025, and am eligible to work in the UK
      without the need for VISA sponsorship. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences
      align with the needs of your team.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the
      future success of the F1 games.</p>
    <p class="mt-10">Sincerely,</p>
    <p class="mt font-bold">Matt Ware</p>
