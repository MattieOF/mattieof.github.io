    <p class="mb-6">21st November 2024</p>
    <p class="font-bold mb-6">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer Intern position at Electronic Arts. As a second-year BSc
      Computer Games Technology student, I am eager to bring my strong skills in C++ programming and passion for game
      development to the EA Sports team, contributing to the next generation of the studio's games and the Frostbite engine.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Over the past 3 years, I have developed my programming skills through multiple personal and academic
      projects. For instance, Ecoscape was a animal habitat management Unreal Engine project in which I created a procedural generation system for terrain,
      multiple custom procedural mesh generation algorithms for generating objects like fences based on the terrain, and
      designer-friendly systems for creating new objects to place in the habitat. Furthermore, I have recently been working on a small multiplayer 2D shooter
      written entirely in C++, with OpenGL, Steamworks, FMOD, and more.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I believe these experiences make me a good fit for a software engineer role at EA - they have not only
      solidified my technical knowledge, but the multiple group projects have taught me the importance of collaboration - I'd love
      to work along designers and artists to help achieve a creative vision fully. Therefore, the opportunity to work on a global
      franchise and with a mature game engine at EA excites me.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I have completed the virtual job simulation mentioned on the job listings. From this experience, I found
      the process satisfying and rewarding, and would like to contribute effectively to existing and new commercial codebases.
      With my academic foundation in programming, including experience with 3D maths concepts, debugging C++ code, and working with
      low-level SDKs such as those used for development on the PlayStation 5, I believe I will be able to contribute to the advanced
      and mature codebases found at EA.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I am available to commence a full-time placement in July 2025, and am eligible to work in the UK
      without the need for VISA sponsorship. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the future
      success of EA's games.</p>
    <p class="mt-10">Sincerely,</p>
    <p class="mt font-bold">Matt Ware</p>
